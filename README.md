# Lox interpreter
This is a C++ implementation of the Lox programming language which is described in the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent). I have written this interpreter as an exercise while following the book (to learn to write interpreters), so it's probably not production-quality code. All features (and some extra ones suggested in the book) are implemented. Compilation requires a C++11-compliant compiler.
